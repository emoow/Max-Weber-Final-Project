# Max-Weber-Final-Project

This is Baiyi Wang's final project for the COMM-4190.
The initial idea is to prompt a Max Weber's spirit who is familiar with Max Weber's pieces and consider social issues in Weber's perspective. 
I also hope the chat box can be more like a real human being with some personalities.
